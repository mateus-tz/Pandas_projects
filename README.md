# Data Analysis with WikiArt Dataset
This Jupyter Notebook contains two main analyses based on the WikiArt dataset:

## Distribution of Paintings Over Time:
The analysis examines the number of artworks across different time periods. It highlights a lower number of works before 1400, followed by a gradual increase until the 16th century. A significant rise in the number of artworks is observed from the 19th century onwards, reaching a peak at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries.

## Distribution of Artworks Across Artistic Styles:
This analysis focuses on the distribution of artworks across 154 different artistic styles present in the dataset. A logarithmic scale is used to represent the values, enabling a clearer visualization of the wide range of styles and their varying frequencies in the dataset.

## Dataset Reference
The dataset used in this analysis was compiled by Sigaki, H. Y. D., Perc, M., and Ribeiro, H. V. in their study "History of art paintings through the lens of entropy and complexity", published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115, E8585â€“E8594 (2018).
